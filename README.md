# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman game project! This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman word guessing game in Python.

## How to Play

1. Run the `hangman.py` file to start the game.
2. You will be presented with underscores representing the letters of a randomly selected word.
3. Guess a letter by entering it through the console.
4. The game will display whether your guess is correct or not.
5. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word, represented by the stages of a hanging man.
6. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the word or run out of attempts.

## Files & Project Structure

- `hangman.py`: The main script manages the game flow, user input, and interactions.
- `hangman_stages.py`: Contains ASCII art of the hanging man for different stages.
- `nounlist.csv`: A CSV file containing a collection of words from which the game randomly selects.

## How to Run

Ensure you have Python installed, and then run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python hangman.py
